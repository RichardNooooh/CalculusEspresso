# JavaCalculus

A simple library that parses a string expression and computes calculus operations on the resulting expression.

TODO
1. Add functions to the ExpressionTree
1a. Add unary operators to postfix notation converter (or some pre/post-processing method) (mostly done. need to do calculus now)
2. Add efficient calculus derivative/integral algorithms

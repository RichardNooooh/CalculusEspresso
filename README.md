# CalculusEspresso

A non-CAS, Java calculus library for computing mathematical expressions. 

##Features
- Multi-variable derivatives and integrals
- Trigonometric functions
    - sine, cosine, tangent
    - secant, cosecant, cotangent
    - arcsine, arccosine
- nth-root and nth-logarithm operators
- Implicit multiplication

##How To Use


###Quick Start (General Use)

###Repetitive Computations

##Other Notes
I built this library on Java 13, however, it should work with lower versions of Java, 
down to Java 1.8. Perhaps in the near future, I'll downgrade this library down to 1.8. 

##Future Features
- Configuration file
    - Levels of precision
    - Implicit Multiplication
- Vector Calculus
    - Internal vectors/matrices
    - Divergence/Curl
- Future versions may or may not be compatible with this current one
